The language of presentation for all papers is English. Please type each manuscript single-spaced on A4 paper (8.5" x 11") with 1-inch margins to maintain uniformity and readability. Title, Abstract, Keywords, Introduction, Materials and Methods, Results, Discussion, Conclusion, Acknowledgment, and References should be the order in which the manuscript is arranged. Following this approach will help your paper's information flow logically and clearly.            </p>

              <li><b>Covering Letter:</b> In addition to the general details (name, address, contact details including mobile number of the corresponding author), it should mention in brief what is already known about this subject and what new is added by the submitted work.</li>
              <li><b>Title Page:</b> Essential information should be clearly given on the title page. The title of the document ought to be written in bold, title case, and with a font size of 14. The authors' names should be in uppercase, regular face, and font size 12. The affiliations of the writers should be listed in lowercase, regular face. An asterisk should be used to denote the corresponding author. The title need to be brief and appropriately convey the essence of the work being conveyed. Initials and surnames should be used when listing authors. Please include the words "*Address for Correspondence" and a working email address in the lower left corner of the title page. The address of the corresponding author should be noted separately if it deviates from the affiliations already given.

Since many databases only list abstracts, the abstract is particularly crucial as it provides a succinct synopsis of the study. A concise summary of all the important facets of the research should be included in the abstract, which should be between 150 and 250 words long. Creating a thorough abstract enables readers to rapidly understand the manuscript's main ideas.</li>
              <li><b>Keywords:</b> Please add four to six pertinent keywords after the abstract.

Provide a brief overview of the study's history. Provide the most recent research that directly affects the topic rather than conducting a thorough literature study. Research aims and objectives must be justified in a clear and unambiguous manner. The study's goal ought to be mentioned in the conclusion. Furthermore, explicitly outline the research's objectives, emphasizing the precise goals and objectives that the study seeks to accomplish. Readers can understand the goal and inspiration of the research by reading an introduction that is straightforward and concise.

</li>
              <li><b>Materials and Methods:</b>  The materials and methods (the way the work was done) should be covered in this section. The chosen method should be explained in enough detail to enable readers to interpret and, if they so want, repeat the experiment. The section must include information about the number of individuals, the number of groups, the study design, the sources of medications with dosing instructions or tools utilized, statistical techniques, and ethical considerations. A description of the data collection process is required. It would be sufficient to provide a previously published reference if the practice is widely used. It is preferable to give a brief description of a procedure that is not widely recognized, even if it has been published before. . Give explicit descriptions of modifications or new methods so that the readers can judge their accuracy, reproducibility and reliability. </li>
              <li><b>Results and Discussion:</b> The accomplishment of the goals outlined in the introduction should be the main emphasis of this section. It should include the results that are displayed as figures, tables, and pictures.</li>

              <li><b>References:</b> Only Vancouver-style references are allowed. Instead of being numbered alphabetically, they should be numbered consecutively according to when they are first mentioned in the text.

References that are only cited in tables or figure legends should be numbered in the order determined by when they were first mentioned in the table or figure's text. Throughout the manuscript, this constant numbering scheme guarantees proper referencing and preserves clarity. </li>
